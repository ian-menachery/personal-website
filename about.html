        <p>
          I'm Ian Menachery, a dedicated professional specializing in data science and economics with a strong passion for leveraging data analytics to unravel economic insights and support strategic decision-making. 
          My professional journey has equipped me with extensive experience in statistical modeling, econometrics, machine learning techniques, and data visualization. I pride myself on transforming intricate datasets into actionable strategies.
          In one recent project, I applied ridge regression to predict IMDb ratings for movies based on various features, including box office earnings, Rotten Tomatoes scores, and movie genres. 
          I addressed challenges like multicollinearity and overfitting through proper data transformation and model regularization.
        </p>
        <p>
          The project involved several key steps:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Data Preprocessing</li>
          <li>Modeling</li>
          <li>Results</li>
          <li>Assumptions Analysis</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The insights gained from this project have significantly deepened my understanding of regression analysis and its practical applications in predicting real-world outcomes.
          Beyond technical skills, I excel at clearly communicating complex analytical outcomes to diverse audiences. 
          Whether teaching microeconomic theory, macroeconomics, or discrete mathematics, I prioritize clarity, collaboration, and real-world applicability.
          I'm continually driven by curiosity and a desire to tackle meaningful economic challenges.
