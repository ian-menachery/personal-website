          I'm Ian Menachery, a dedicated professional specializing in data science and economics with a strong passion for leveraging data analytics to unravel economic insights and support strategic decision-making. 
          My professional journey has equipped me with extensive experience in statistical modeling, econometrics, machine learning techniques, and data visualization. I pride myself on transforming intricate datasets into actionable strategies.
          In one recent project, I applied ridge regression to predict IMDb ratings for movies based on various features, including box office earnings, Rotten Tomatoes scores, and movie genres. 
          I addressed challenges like multicollinearity and overfitting through proper data transformation and model regularization.
        </p>
        <p>
          The project involved several key steps:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Data Preprocessing</li>
          <li>Modeling</li>
          <li>Results</li>
          <li>Assumptions Analysis</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The insights gained from this project have significantly deepened my understanding of regression analysis and its practical applications in predicting real-world outcomes.
          Beyond technical skills, I excel at clearly communicating complex analytical outcomes to diverse audiences. 
          Whether teaching microeconomic theory, macroeconomics, or discrete mathematics, I prioritize clarity, collaboration, and real-world applicability.
          I'm continually driven by curiosity and a desire to tackle meaningful economic challenges.

      <h2>Current Project: Mapping Asian Flight Routes</h2>

        <p>
          One of the most exciting projects I’m currently working on is a large-scale data visualization that maps commercial flight routes across Asia. 
          The goal is to uncover geographic patterns in airline operations — such as which regions are heavily trafficked, how flight time correlates with distance, and how carriers differ in coverage.
        </p>

        <p>
          I started by collecting and preprocessing a dataset containing thousands of flight records with detailed attributes like origin and destination coordinates, airline name, estimated distance, and flight time.
          After cleaning and formatting the data, I used Vega-Lite — a powerful grammar for interactive graphics — to create a layered map projection that plots each route as a curved line between airports. 
          Airlines are color-coded, and users can hover over routes to view metadata like IATA codes, travel time, and carrier.
        </p>

        <p>
          From a technical perspective, the project gave me the opportunity to deepen my understanding of:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Geospatial analysis</strong> — mapping coordinates onto Earth projections and tuning scale/center for legibility</li>
            <li><strong>Data wrangling</strong> — standardizing IATA codes, removing nulls, filtering by region, and handling multivalued airline fields</li>
            <li><strong>Declarative visualization</strong> — composing layered Vega-Lite specs for both the world map and flight arcs</li>
            <li><strong>User experience</strong> — choosing color palettes and interactivity tools that balance aesthetics with clarity</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
          The project is still evolving — I’m currently working on adding filters to view routes by country, airline, or distance thresholds. I also plan to integrate airport metadata like city population or elevation to explore possible correlations.
